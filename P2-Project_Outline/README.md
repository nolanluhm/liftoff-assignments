## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app is meant as a way to inform and connect potential/current customer's to Auntie Liz LLC. Users will find it useful to find all of the relevant information regarding her business such as who Lis is, how the business can help the user, the services and pricing, and miscellaneous information. Users can also find value in the website by being utilizing the review section to leave views and to find reviews given by previous customers with the business. 

This idea came as Liz had decided to start her business while I was in LC101. I thought that her need for a website and my need to build my skillset in web development would make for a good opportunity that benefitted both parties.
